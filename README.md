# Cat Tinder App

## Overview
The **Cat Tinder App** is a fun, interactive web application that allows users to swipe through cat images like a dating app. Users can like, dislike, or super-like a cat, and each swipe fetches new cat images along with their breed information and temperament.

## Features
- Displays random cat images fetched from **TheCatAPI**.
- Shows additional cat details such as **breed name, description, and temperament**.
- Users can interact using three buttons: **Like, Dislike, and Super Like**.
- Fetches fresh cat images and breed details on every interaction.
- Uses two separate API requests for **cat images** and **breed information**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for frontend development.
- **TheCatAPI** for retrieving cat images and breed data.
- **Fetch API** to make HTTP requests.
- **GitHub** for version control and project hosting.

## API Endpoints Used
1. **Random Cat Image**: Fetches a random cat image from TheCatAPI.
2. **Breed Information**: Retrieves the breed name, description, and temperament.
